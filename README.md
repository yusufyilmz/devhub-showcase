Here’s the modified README for your devhub-showcase repository, following the format you requested:

# DevHub Showcase

This is Yusuf’s DevHub Showcase, a portfolio application built using Next.js, React, Typescript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Material UI, ChatGPT and Tailwind CSS. It includes public project showcases, a CV page, and an interactive AI chat bot app that is written by using the chat GPT and with NLP techniques for classification.

## Using this repository

Run the following command to clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yusufyilmz/devhub-showcase.git
cd devhub-showcase
```

## What’s inside?

This Turborepo includes the following apps and packages:

2. Install dependencies

	1. web: A Next.js app that serves as the portfolio.
	2. @shared/ui: A shared React component library using Material UI and Tailwind CSS, shared across the app.
	3. @shared/eslint-config: eslint configurations (includes eslint-config-next and eslint-config-prettier).
	4. @shared/typescript-config: tsconfig.jsons used throughout the monorepo.

Each package/app is 100% TypeScript.

3. Set up the database

This Turborepo has some additional tools already set up for you:

	•	TypeScript for static type checking.
	•	ESLint for code linting.
	•	Prettier for code formatting.

#### Build

yarn prisma migrate dev --name init
yarn prisma db seed

```
yarn build
```

#### Develop

Your project will be available at http://localhost:3000.

```
yarn dev
```

#### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as Remote Caching to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching, you will need an account with Vercel. If you don’t have an account, you can create one, then enter the following commands:

```
npx turbo login

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your Vercel account.

Next, link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your repository:

```
npx turbo link
